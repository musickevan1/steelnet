# SteelNet: CNN-Based Defect Detection in Manufacturing Images

This project presents **SteelNet**, a Convolutional Neural Network model built using transfer learning with ResNet18, designed to automate the classification of six steel surface defects from the NEU-DET dataset. The model is evaluated against a classical machine learning approach using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

### 📊 Key Results

| Model         | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| HOG + SVM     | 92.44%   | 0.9231   |
| SteelNet CNN  | 89.6%    | 0.91     |

### 🛠 Features

- **Preprocessing**: Image resizing (224x224), normalization, and augmentation (flip, rotation)
- **Architecture**: ResNet18 with a custom classification head for 6 defect classes
- **Training**: Adam optimizer, Cross-Entropy loss, LR scheduling via ReduceLROnPlateau
- **Classical Baseline**: HOG feature extraction + SVM with RBF kernel
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, macro-averaged F1-score, per-class metrics

### 📂 Dataset

**NEU-DET**: 1,800 grayscale images (6 classes × 300 images), available at  
🔗 [Kaggle NEU Surface Defect Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhdikshit/neu-surface-defect-database)

### 📌 Highlights from Report

- SteelNet outperformed HOG + SVM on defect types like *patches* and *pitted surface*
- HOG + SVM showed superior results on *crazing*, *inclusion*, and *rolled-in scale*
- Clear signs of early overfitting in CNN after ~8 epochs
- Future work: Grad-CAM explainability, ensemble models, real-time deployment
